# CODEX_LOG

### Update 2026-05-14 02:12
- Decisions: Added required project context files before making packaging changes.
- Implementation: Created `codex.md` with concise project context and initialized this technical work log.
- Open: `pyproject.toml` cleanup still in progress.
- Risks/Assumptions: Context is inferred from current repository files and may need refinement as project conventions evolve.

### Update 2026-05-14 02:13
- Decisions: Modernized package metadata with PEP 621 `[project]` fields and kept Poetry-only packaging controls under `[tool.poetry]`.
- Implementation: Split runtime dependencies from optional `docs` and `dev` dependency groups, removed redundant `[tool.mkdocs]` config, updated the build backend requirement to Poetry Core 2, and synchronized `oldaplib/src/version.py` with the package version.
- Open: Fresh local installs that need documentation or release tooling should use `poetry install --with docs,dev`.
- Risks/Assumptions: License was normalized to the SPDX expression `AGPL-3.0-only`, matching the previous "GNU Affero General Public License version 3" wording.

### Update 2026-05-14 02:20
- Decisions: Standard ontologies are not runtime package data for distribution artifacts.
- Implementation: Excluded `oldaplib/ontologies/standard` from Poetry builds.
- Open: Rebuild release artifacts before publishing so the old included standard ontology files disappear from `dist`.
- Risks/Assumptions: Code paths that need standard ontologies must obtain them outside the installed package, for example through repository checkout data or the existing ontology download workflow.
